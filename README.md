# CREST_2020_reading_group_networks
This is the repository for the network reading group 2020.

The reading group mainly focuses on networks in the transport and trade litterature.
We meet on Wenesday afternoons, every two weeks. 
There is an associated Dropbox for the reading group. Ask Isabelle MÃ©jean for access.

This repository will focus on code work.
